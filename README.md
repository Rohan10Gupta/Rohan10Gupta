### Hello there!:wave:

I am Rohan Gupta, a MSEN graduate in Boston. As an Engineering Management student, I am passionate about applying Data Science to drive high level decision making. My varied background in Data Science, Electronics, and Business Management gives me a unique insight into using high level Data Mining techniques for creating business value out of raw data. Currently, in my curriculum at Northeastern University, I am exposed to all facets of Data Driven Decision Making, with equal emphasis on both aspects of this field. Courses like Data Mining, and Data Computation prepare me for extracting maximum value out of data, while management driven courses like Pricing and Revenue Management, and Economic Decision Making allow me to use insights from data in a real world setting. 

With the modern business world transforming from intuition based decisions to more data driven applications, it is my goal to be at the forefront of this revolution and utilize my skills to the best of my abilities to create maximum value out of the unfathomably large amounts of data being generated daily. 

On the personal side, I am an amateur author, having published a number of short stories on a variety of platforms. I believe that people benefit from having a creative outlet, and mine allows me to become a better data driven storyteller and presenter, skills that I plan on leveraging in my professional career as well!

If you wish to contact me, I am always available via email at: gupta.roha@northeastern.edu
